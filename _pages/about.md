Hi there! I am a PhD student at the UKP Lab at the Technical University of Darmstadt (Germany). My research revolves around methods for efficient model training in natural language processing (NLP). This usually involves methods that can tackle low-data scenarios such as active learning with users who can provide the labels for queried instances. I am also interested in computer-assisted language learning (CALL) in the context of automated exercise generation and assessment. If you are interested in these research topics feel free to drop me a message! 

Activities
======
During my PhD, I had the pleasure to be part of various other activities besides my research. 

Workshop Organization
------
Since 2021, I am a part of the organizing team of the workshop on interactive learning for natural language processing (InterNLP). After a break in 2023, we are currently working on a new issue for 2024/25. If you are interested in joining the programme committee, please feel free to reach out! You can find all papers and talks of the past workshops below: 

* [InterNLP 2022](https://internlp.github.io/2022/index.html) (co-located with NeurIPS 2022)
* [InterNLP 2021](https://sites.google.com/view/internlp2021/home) (co-located with ACL 2021)

Community Engagement
------
Since 2019, I am a regular reviewer at major NLP and other machine learning conferences. I have received multiple outstanding reviewer awards (ACL 2020, EACL 2021, and ARR 10/2024). I also review at various workshops, most notably at [BEA](https://sig-edu.org/bea/).

Talks
------
* Invited talk: Facets of efficiency in NLP. ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6vs2nc2-HA)), KUIS AI, KoÂ¸c University. September, 2022.
* Spotlight talk: nvestigating rational activation functions to train Transformer models. Dagstuhl Seminar on Efficient and Equitable Natural Language Processing in the Age of Deep Learning ([webpage](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/22232)). June, 2022.
