Project coordinator of 50+ software projects for undergrads 

Course Contents
======
The purpose of this course is to provide undergrads with hands-on experience in their first longer software project. For this, they are put together in teams of four to five students and receive a software project that are proposed by members of the university. These can for instance be to implement a user interface to visualize some cool research, or even programming a rasberry pie to automatically receive and manage orders for a coffee machine. 

The learning goals of the course are to experience agile software development in a team, including the iterative development of feature requests, the creation of functioning software, continuous integration and quality assurance, dealing with problems within the team and the final presentation of the results.  

The project is accompanied by a lecture where students are taught relevant software engineering concepts and furthermore, a full-day workshop where they can hone their presentation skills.
