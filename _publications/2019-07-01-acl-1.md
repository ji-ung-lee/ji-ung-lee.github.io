excerpt: 'In this work, we propose two novel generation strategies for C-Tests, a type of gap filling exercises. In contrast to previous approaches, our strategies do not rely upon a static gap placement and size. This allows teachers to generate C-Tests of multiple difficulties from a single input text. In a user study, we show that both our proposed methods are capable successfully manipulating the C-Test difficulty.'

Abstract
------
We propose two novel manipulation strategies for increasing and decreasing the difficulty of C-tests automatically. This is a crucial step towards generating learner-adaptive exercises for self-directed language learning and preparing language assessment tests. To reach the desired difficulty level, we manipulate the size and the distribution of gaps based on absolute and relative gap difficulty predictions. We evaluate our approach in corpus-based experiments and in a user study with 60 participants. We find that both strategies are able to generate C-tests with the desired difficulty level.
