Community Engagement
------
Since 2019, I am a regular reviewer at major NLP and machine learning conferences (please check my [cv](https://ji-ung-lee.github.io/files/github-cv.pdf) for details). I have received outstanding reviewer awards, most notably at ACL 2020, EACL 2021, and ARR. I also review at various workshops such as [BEA](https://sig-edu.org/bea/).
